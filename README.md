# Setup the environment

- All the stuff you need to know about environment and python libriaries is - [here](https://github.com/google-research/football)

- Observations and Actions list is - [here](https://github.com/google-research/football/blob/master/gfootball/doc/observation.md)

- Compile the GRF-Engine [instructions](https://github.com/google-research/football/blob/master/gfootball/doc/compile_engine.md#windows)

# Interact with GRF environment 

You can interact with GRF environment and learn how to use it through [Simple_Observations.ipynb](https://github.com/Georgemouts/Google-Research-Football-RL/blob/main/Simple_Observations.ipynb)

# Learning & Playing :open_book:

Implemented algorithm **Deep Q-Learning(DQN)**  based on [Deepmind's paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf)

We need : 
  - The replay buffer
  - EpisolonGreedy action selection

We dont need:
  - Target neural network

# Reward System

The environment has +1 reward for when our team scores and -1 when the opponent teams scores.

Custom Rewards:
